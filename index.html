      <h1>A zoom across PERM petitions</h1>
      <h4>What is a PERM petition?</h4>
      <p>A Permanent Labor Certification, well-known as PERM (Program Electronic Review Management), 
      is usually the first step of three steps to obtain permanent work authorization in the US. This is one of the
       most important steps because after the certification of a PERM the employer demonstrates that there are no U.S.
        workers who are able, willing, qualified, and available to perform the work being given to the foreign worker 
        and that the employment of the foreign worker will not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of 
        similarly employed U.S. workers. When this step is already completed and CERTIFIED the employer can apply for 
        a green card from the USCIS on behalf of a foreign national.</p>
      <h4>What is the process to obtain a PERM?</h4>
      <p>To CERTIFIED a PERM, the employer needs to file a petition on the Department of Labor (DOL) giving some basic information of the job as:<br>
      <br>
      - Duties and minimum requirements for the position.<br>
      - Prevailing wage<br>
      - The employer must go through an recruitment process. Posting the job position and interviewing potential U.S. workers who apply<br>
      - Once the recruitment process is completed, the employer need to fill the ETA-9089 form.<br>
      After all these processes are completed and audited, you can get the resolution of your PERM petition.</p>

    <!--Case Status to the topic-->

      <div class='explanation2'>
      <h4>What are the possibles status of my PERM?</h4>
      <p>The possibles "Case Status" of a PERM are:<br>
      <br>
      - Certified: The applicant successfully fulfill all the conditions.<br>
      - Certified-Expired: The PERM was approved, but was not filed with a FORM I â€“ 140 within 180 days of the approval.<br>
      - Denied: The application is denied.<br>
      - Withdrawn: The employer has withdrawn the application.<br></p>
      <h4>How many Petitions are processed yearly?</h4>
      <p>On the right graph, the black line represents the total PERM petitions made under a specific year. 
      The number of total petitions between 2015-2019 is 504,690. From the graph, you can see a drop-in 
      requests in the year 2017, as a personal opinion I feel that this may be due to the fact that this year 
      was assumed by President Donald Trump who promised to modify some conditions of the PERM, for which many 
      employers decided to suspend sponsoring international workers until the new guidelines were promulgated.</p>
      <h4>How is the distribution of case status of PERM petitions?</h4>
      <p>The four lines at the bottom represent each of the case status, also the sum of these lines is the black line which represents the total petitions.<br>
      As we can notice from the graph, during 2018 and 2019, many people are filling the form I-140 within 180 days of the approval of PERM decreasing the
      number of Certified-Expired and at the same time increasing the Certified. </p>

    <h1>Let's analyze the CERTIFIED PERM petitions</h1>
    <p>Now that we have an idea about how many petitions are between years 2015-2019, I want to focus our attention on the CERTIFIED
    or approved PERM petitions which potentially will result in a permanent resident with legal work authorization in the U.S.
    During this path, we wanted not only to show the portion of the approved petitioners between 2015-2019 are compared to the total jobs 
    in the U.S. during 2019, but also I wanted to show where they are coming from and how the world continents are distributed amount these PERM's.</p>

          <p>From the Circle-Packing graph on the right, we appreciate that PERM petitions from 2015-2019 are just a small
