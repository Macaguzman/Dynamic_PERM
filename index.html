      <h1>A zoom across PERM petitions</h1>
      <h4>What is a PERM petition?</h4>
      <p>A Permanent Labor Certification, well-known as PERM (Program Electronic Review Management), 
      is usually the first of three steps to obtain permanent work authorization in the US. This is the
       most important step because the employer demonstrates that there are no U.S.
        workers who are able, willing, qualified, and available to perform the work being given to the foreign worker 
        and that the employment of the foreign worker will not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of 
        similarly employed U.S. workers. When this step is already completed and CERTIFIED the employer can apply for 
        a green card from the USCIS on behalf of a foreign national.</p>
      <h4>What is the process to obtain a PERM?</h4>
      <p>To CERTIFIED a PERM, the employer needs to file a petition on the Department of Labor (DOL) completing the following steps:<br>
      <br>
      - Define duties and minimum requirements for the position.<br>
      - Determinate the prevailing wage<br>
      - Go through a recruitment process, posting the job position and interviewing potential U.S. workers who apply<br>
      - Once the recruitment process is completed, fill the ETA-9089 form.<br>
      After all these processes are completed and audited, you can get the resolution of your PERM petition.</p>

    <!--Case Status to the topic-->

      <div class='explanation2'>
      <h4>What are the possibles status of my PERM?</h4>
      <p>The possibles "Case Status" of a PERM are:<br>
      <br>
      - Certified: The applicant successfully fulfilled all the conditions.<br>
      - Certified-Expired: The PERM was approved, but was not filed with a FORM I – 140 within 180 days of the approval.<br>
      - Denied: The application is denied.<br>
      - Withdrawn: The employer has withdrawn the application.<br></p>
      <h4>How many Petitions are processed yearly?</h4>
      <p>On the right graph, the black line represents the total PERM petitions made under a specific year. 
      The number of total petitions between 2015-2019 is 504,690. From the graph, there is a significant drop in 
      requests during 2017. As a personal opinion, I think this may be due to the fact that in 2017 
      President Donald Trump was elected and he promised to tighten some conditions of the PERM, pushing many 
      employers to suspend sponsoring international workers until the new guidelines were promulgated.</p>
      <h4>How is the distribution of case status of PERM petitions?</h4>
      <p>The four lines below the total cases represent each of the case status, also the sum of all of them equals the black line(total petitions).<br>
      As we can notice from the graph, during 2018 and 2019, many people filled the form I-140 within 180 days of the PERM approval, decreasing the
      number of Certified-Expired and at the same time increasing the Certified petitions. </p>

    <h1>Let's analyze the CERTIFIED PERM petitions</h1>
    <p>Now that we have an idea about how many petitions were requested between years 2015-2019, I want to focus our attention on the CERTIFIED (approved) 
    PERM petitions which could translate into a permanent resident with legal work authorization in the U.S.
    In the following graphs, I want not only to show the portion of the approved petitioners between 2015-2019 compared to the total jobs 
    in the U.S. during 2019, but also I want to show where they are coming from and how the world continents are distributed among the total PERM petitions.<br>
    <br>
    The graphs below were made using a circle packaging approach, which shows the info in a hierarchical way were each node is represented by a circle. Thus, the magnitude will reset to the specific continent 
    and set a new hierarchy each time you zoom a graph.</p>

          <h2>"PERM approved petitions are a 0.17% of U.S Total Employment"</h2>
          <p>From the Circle-Packing graph on the right, we see that PERM petitions from 2015-2019 are just a small 
          a portion of the U.S employment. Indeed, the PERM approved petitions from 2015-2019 is just 0.17% of
           total employment at 2019.<br>

          <p>Asia is one of the leaders in approved petitions, however, this continent is also the leader in the number of petitions requested, so the fact that it has more petitions approved is expected. The approval rate independent of the continent,
